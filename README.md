# Bayesian compartmental models for COVID-19

**Update**: if you're interested in running or modifying MechBayes, you probably want to use the repo at https://github.com/dsheldon/mechbayes instead. It has a streamlined version of the model we operated from roughly August 2021 until we stopped submitting forecasts with MechBayes. It has better scripting and less cruft.


This repository contains code for Bayesian estimation of compartmental
models for COVID-19 using [numpyro](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/numpyro) and [jax](https://github.com/google/jax).

## Models

We are experimenting with different Bayesian compartmental models. The basic ingredients are:
* classical [compartmental models from epidemiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology)
* prior distributions on parameters
* models for time-varying dynamics
* models for partial/noisy observations of confirmed cases and deaths
* Bayesian inference using [numpyro](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/numpyro)

This [Bayesian SEIRD model](docs/Bayesian%20SEIRD%20Model.pdf) is current as of April 27, 2020. Model code [here](covid/models/SEIRD.py).

## Team

The team is based at the [College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) and [School of Public Health & Health Sciences](https://www.umass.edu/sphhs/) at [UMass](https://www.umass.edu). The model contributors are:

* [Dan Sheldon](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~sheldon/)
* [Casey Gibson](https://gcgibson.github.io/)
* [Nick Reich](https://reichlab.io/people)

Dr. Reich directs the [CDC Influenza Forecasting Center of Excellence](https://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/cdc-designates-umass-amherst-flu) at UMass.

## Installation

Our code depends on recent *development* versions of numpyro and jax. If you don't have these packages and don't care about tracking their versions, our installation routine will pull and install them as unversioned packages:
~~~
git clone https://github.com/dsheldon/covid
cd covid
pip install -e .
~~~

## Installation Details

If you need to manually install jax and numpyro, here are rough instructions. More details can be found at the project sites.

Install jaxlib (more info [here](https://github.com/google/jax#installation))
~~~
pip install --upgrade jaxlib
~~~

Install jax (more into [here](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer.html#building-from-source))
~~~
git clone https://github.com/google/jax
cd jax
pip install -e .
~~~

Install numpyro (more details [here](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/numpyro))
~~~
git clone https://github.com/pyro-ppl/numpyro.git
cd numpyro
pip install -e .[dev]
~~~
